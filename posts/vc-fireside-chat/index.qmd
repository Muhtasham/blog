## Introduction:

The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) startups is rapidly evolving, and so are the strategies for building a successful and defensible business. A recent discussion panel featured Sarah Catanzaro (Amplify Partners) and Matt Bornstein (a16z), who shared their insights on how to navigate the challenging world of AI startups. The panel was moderated by Josh Tobin (gantry), during LLM bootcamp 2023 in San Francisco.

## Asking the Right Questions to VCs:
The panelists emphasized the importance of asking the right questions to venture capitalists (VCs). Understanding their perspectives, investment strategies, and areas of interest can provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs seeking funding and support.

## Challenging the Status Quo:
Entrepreneurs should not hesitate to test their ideas, even if they contradict the opinions of VCs. Trusting your instincts and validating your hypothesis in the market is crucial for success.

## Saving Money on GPUs:
The panelists advised against investing heavily in GPUs before achieving product-market fit. It is essential to validate your business model and product before committing significant resources to AI hardware.

## Embracing Change and Adaptation:
Founders should be prepared to pivot and adapt to the ever-changing AI landscape. Regular reevaluation of business strategies and product offerings is key to staying relevant and competitive.

## Creating Value for Users:
A crucial factor in building a defensible business is the amount of value your product or service creates for users. Ensuring that your offering addresses a genuine need and provides tangible benefits can help to build a loyal customer base.

## VCs' Love for Tools and Platforms:
The panelists highlighted that VCs are particularly interested in investing in tools and platforms, as they can enable the growth of entire ecosystems.

## LLMOps and Multimodal Markets:
According to the panelists, the markets for low-latency machine learning operations (LLMOps) and multimodal AI applications are currently booming, presenting numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs.

## Bringing Products and Users to the Table:
Ideally, startups should approach investors with an existing product and user base. Demonstrating traction and market interest can significantly improve the chances of securing funding.

## Turnover Technology:
The panelists noted that turnover technology is a hot area for investment. Tools that help companies improve their employee turnover rates and streamline operations are particularly attractive to VCs.


## The Impermanence of AI Models:
The panelists warned against spending too much time and resources on training AI models, as they can become obsolete within months. Additionally, entrepreneurs should consider whether their models will outperform the next generation of AI models, such as GPT-5, before investing significant resources.

## Conclusion:
Building a defensible AI business requires a combination of perseverance, adaptability, and a keen understanding of market trends. By focusing on creating value for users, targeting high-growth sectors, and making strategic investments in technology, entrepreneurs can increase their chances of success in the ever-evolving world of AI.
