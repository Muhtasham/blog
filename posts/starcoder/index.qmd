Are you tired of spending hours writing repetitive code? Do you find yourself searching through documentation and Stack Overflow for code snippets? Look no further! Introducing StarCoder, the ultimate code generation model that will revolutionize your coding experience.

## Understanding StarCoder

### The Power of 15 Billion Parameters

The Power of 15 Billion Parameters: StarCoder is a cutting-edge code generation model that boasts an impressive 15 billion parameters. Built on a decoder architecture, this model has been fine-tuned to excel in generating high-quality code across various programming languages.

### Trained on The Stack

The Stack, a vast collection of programming languages and metadata with a staggering 6.4 TB of permissively licensed code, served as the training ground for StarCoder. With 800GB of code spanning 86 popular programming languages, including GitHub Issues, Jupyter Notebooks, and Git Commits, StarCoder has acquired a deep understanding of diverse codebases.

### Recent Techniques for Enhanced Performance

StarCoder utilizes advanced techniques such as Multi Query Attention and Flash Attention to optimize memory usage and improve context length. With an impressive context window of 8,192 tokens, equivalent to several pages of code, StarCoder enables you to generate comprehensive code snippets.

### StarPII: Safeguarding Privacy

Before training StarCoder, a separate model called StarPII was developed to ensure the removal of personally identifiable information (PII) such as IP addresses, names, and passwords. This commitment to data privacy ensures the responsible use of code generation capabilities.

### Outperforming the Giants

In rigorous Human Evaluation (Human Eval) benchmarks, StarCoder surpassed many large models, including PaLM 1 540B and LLaMa 66. StarCoder's superior performance is a testament to its finely tuned code generation capabilities.

## Unleashing the Power of StarCoder
With StarCoder, the possibilities are endless. Let's explore some exciting use cases where StarCoder's productivity gains truly shine:

### 1. Efficient Code Generation

StarCoder simplifies code generation by automating repetitive tasks. With just a few lines of code, you can leverage StarCoder's capabilities to generate code snippets tailored to your specific requirements. Whether you need a function definition or a complete code block, StarCoder has got you covered.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

checkpoint = "bigcode/starcoder"
device = "cuda"  # Set to "cuda" for GPU usage or "cpu" for CPU usage

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True).to(device)

inputs = tokenizer.encode("def print_hello_world():", return_tensors="pt").to(device)
outputs = model.generate(inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```
> Pro Tip: You can use google collab to avoid memmoru issues

### 2. Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion

StarCoder excels at fill-in-the-middle code completion tasks. By providing context and using special tokens, you can generate code snippets with missing parts accurately filled. This feature is particularly useful when you have an existing codebase and need to complete or modify code segments efficiently.

```python
input_text = "<fim-prefix>def print_hello_world():\n    <fim-suffix>\n    print('Hello world!')<fim-middle>"
inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
outputs = model.generate(inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```


### 3. Enhancing Reasoning and Conversational Tasks

Surprisingly, StarCoder demonstrates remarkable performance in reasoning and conversational tasks, despite not being explicitly trained on text data. The combination of well-crafted prompts and the model's inherent reasoning abilities derived from code pre-training contribute to its success. In fact, in the Helm evaluation, StarCoder achieved scores comparable to models such as Anthropic V4 and GPT-3, which are significantly larger in size.

## Fine-tuning and Commercial Use

StarCoder offers the flexibility of fine-tuning to cater to specific use cases. By following the steps provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder), you can fine-tune the model according to your requirements. This makes StarCoder an ideal choice for enterprises with strict usage requirements and specialized code generation needs.

Furthermore, StarCoder is available for commercial use, enabling businesses to leverage its power to boost productivity and efficiency in their software development workflows.

## Training Insights

For those curious about the technical aspects of StarCoder's training, here are some key details:

- **Architecture**: StarCoder is built upon the GPT-2 model, utilizing multi-query attention and the Fill-in-the-Middle objective.
- **Pretraining Steps**: StarCoder underwent 600K pretraining steps to acquire its vast code generation capabilities.
- **Pretraining Tokens**: During pretraining, StarCoder processed a staggering 236 billion tokens, allowing it to learn from an extensive corpus of code.
- **Precision**: StarCoder was trained with float16 precision, striking a balance between training efficiency and model performance.

## Open-Source Community

StarCoder is not just a powerful code generation model, but also an open-source project driven by a collaborative community. The development of StarCoder has been made possible by the collective efforts of developers, researchers, and coding enthusiasts like yourself.

Contributions from community members play a crucial role in refining and expanding the capabilities of StarCoder.
