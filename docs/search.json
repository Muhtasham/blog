    "text": "Welcome to my new blog and my new home on the internet!\nMy name is Muhtasham and I am excited to share my journey and learning in the field of machine learning with all of you. After publishing on Medium for a while, I have decided to make the switch to here in order to have a more personalized space to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on this rapidly evolving field.\nOn this blog, you can expect to find articles and tutorials on a wide range of machine learning topics, including Machine Learning and Information Theory. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field and sharing that knowledge with others. In addition to written content, I will also be sharing code tutorials and demonstrations to help readers better understand and apply the concepts I discuss.\nI hope that this blog will not only serve as a source of information and inspiration for those interested in machine learning, but also as a way for me to connect with like-minded individuals and continue learning from others in the community. Thank you for joining me on this journey and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and growth with all of you. This is my new home on the internet and I am excited to have you all as my virtual neighbors. Let‚Äôs learn and grow together!"

    "text": "As I look back on the year 2022, I can‚Äôt help but feel a sense of nostalgia and wonder.\n\nüåä¬†Intro\nIt‚Äôs been a challenging year for many of us, with all the ups and downs that come with life. But despite the difficulties, I remain hopeful that things will get better.\n\n\n‚ú®¬†Some highlights of the year\nOne of the biggest highlights of the year was completing my master‚Äôs thesis. This was a major milestone for me, and one that I dedicated to my late grandfather Boboi Usto, who was an educator and convinced my father to move our family to the city from a distant village to get a better education. I‚Äôm grateful for my grandfather‚Äôs influence and for the opportunity to receive a good education, and I‚Äôm proud of all the hard work I put into my thesis.\nThe experience of completing my thesis was immersive and full of learning, and I‚Äôm now working on making it more generalizable. It‚Äôs an exciting process, and I‚Äôm looking forward to refining my findings and sharing them with a wider audience.\nAs I reflect on the role that my grandfather played in my education and career, I‚Äôm reminded of the importance of appreciating our ancestors and the sacrifices they made to provide opportunities for future generations. It‚Äôs easy to take the things we have for granted, but it‚Äôs important to remember that they are often the result of hard work and dedication on the part of those who came before us.\nIn addition to completing my thesis, I also had the chance to participate in four hackathons this year, and I‚Äôm proud to say that I won in three of them. It was a great experience to work with a team to come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems, and I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to put my skills to the test.\nI also took the opportunity to share my thoughts and experiences through writing. I published two blog posts on Medium, which gave me the chance to reflect on my journey and share my insights with others.\n\nüî• One of the other major highlights of the year was co-founding MunichNLP community in May and being able to organise 17 events in a short time span. And exchanging thoughts with great researchers from Google Research and Brain team.\n\nIt‚Äôs been great to be able to bring together individuals who are passionate about machine learning, and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to grow and develop the group in the coming year.\nThe last but by no means least, I found new HOME at MunichRe, on a very interesting and challenging project. I plan to share my learning next year through my writings, so stay tuned.\n\n\nüåÑ¬†Wanderlust within me\nIn addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I also made the most of my time by exploring the beautiful Alps and nature surrounding Bavaria. I also had the chance to travel to new countries, including Italy üáÆüáπ and Switzerland üá®üá≠¬†\n\nüçù In Italy, I fell in love with the delicious and flavourful cuisine, which was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. From the classic pasta dishes to the mouthwatering pizzas, I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the fresh, high-quality ingredients and simple, yet satisfying flavours.\n\n\nüèîÔ∏è In Switzerland, I was mesmerised by the stunning natural beauty of the country, with its soaring peaks and crystal-clear lakes. The mountains were rugged and wild, with trails that led up to breathtaking vistas. And the lakes were so clear and pure that you could see right down to the bottom.\n\nThese were unforgettable experience and one that I will always treasure.\n\n\nüß©¬†Outro\nAs I look ahead to the next year, I have a few goals in mind. First, I want to make my fitness more consistent. I also hope to give a talk at PyData Berlin conference and attend NeurIPS ‚Äô23 (aka The Deep Learning conference of the year). I believe that setting goals is an important way to stay motivated and to continue to grow and learn, and I‚Äôm looking forward to working towards these goals in the coming year.\nTo conclude, I‚Äôm grateful for all the opportunities I‚Äôve had and for the support of my family, friends, and colleagues. I‚Äôm excited to see what the next year brings, and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to pursue my passions and goals.\nAs Albert Einstein once said,\n\nI have no special talent, I am only passionately curious.\n\nI hope to stay curious and continue to learn and grow in the coming year.\n\nThank you for reading my year in review. I hope that you have enjoyed learning about my experiences and adventures in 2022. I wish you all the best and hope that your future is filled with joy and success. Thank you for your support and here‚Äôs to a bright future ahead!"
