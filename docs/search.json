    "text": "📝 Preface\nAs I look back on the year 2022, I can’t help but feel a sense of nostalgia and wonder.\n\n\n\n🌊 Intro\nIt’s been a challenging year for many of us, with all the ups and downs that come with life. But despite the difficulties, I remain hopeful that things will get better.\n\n\n✨ Some highlights of the year\nOne of the biggest highlights of the year was completing my master’s thesis. This was a major milestone for me, and one that I dedicated to my late grandfather Boboi Usto, who was an educator and convinced my father to move our family to the city from a distant village to get a better education. I’m grateful for my grandfather’s influence and for the opportunity to receive a good education, and I’m proud of all the hard work I put into my thesis.\nThe experience of completing my thesis was immersive and full of learning, and I’m now working on making it more generalizable. It’s an exciting process, and I’m looking forward to refining my findings and sharing them with a wider audience.\nAs I reflect on the role that my grandfather played in my education and career, I’m reminded of the importance of appreciating our ancestors and the sacrifices they made to provide opportunities for future generations. It’s easy to take the things we have for granted, but it’s important to remember that they are often the result of hard work and dedication on the part of those who came before us.\nIn addition to completing my thesis, I also had the chance to participate in four hackathons this year, and I’m proud to say that I won in three of them. It was a great experience to work with a team to come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to put my skills to the test.\nI also took the opportunity to share my thoughts and experiences through writing. I published two blog posts on Medium, which gave me the chance to reflect on my journey and share my insights with others.\n🔥 One of the other major highlights of the year was co-founding MunichNLP community in May and being able to organise 17 events in a short time span. And exchanging thoughts with great researchers from Google Research and Brain team.\nIt’s been great to be able to bring together individuals who are passionate about machine learning, and I’m looking forward to continuing to grow and develop the group in the coming year.\nThe last but by no means least, I found new HOME at MunichRe, on a very interesting and challenging project. I plan to share my learning next year through my writings, so stay tuned.\n\n\n🌄 Wanderlust within me\nIn addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I also made the most of my time by exploring the beautiful Alps and nature surrounding Bavaria. I also had the chance to travel to new countries, including Italy 🇮🇹 and Switzerland 🇨🇭 \n🍝 In Italy, I fell in love with the delicious and flavourful cuisine, which was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. From the classic pasta dishes to the mouthwatering pizzas, I couldn’t get enough of the fresh, high-quality ingredients and simple, yet satisfying flavours.\n🏔️ In Switzerland, I was mesmerised by the stunning natural beauty of the country, with its soaring peaks and crystal-clear lakes. The mountains were rugged and wild, with trails that led up to breathtaking vistas. And the lakes were so clear and pure that you could see right down to the bottom.\nThese were unforgettable experience and one that I will always treasure.\n\n\n🧩 Outro\nAs I look ahead to the next year, I have a few goals in mind. First, I want to make my fitness more consistent. I also hope to give a talk at PyData Berlin conference and attend NeurIPS ’23 (aka The Deep Learning conference of the year). I believe that setting goals is an important way to stay motivated and to continue to grow and learn, and I’m looking forward to working towards these goals in the coming year.\nTo conclude, I’m grateful for all the opportunities I’ve had and for the support of my family, friends, and colleagues. I’m excited to see what the next year brings, and I’m looking forward to continuing to pursue my passions and goals.\nAs Albert Einstein once said,\n\nI have no special talent, I am only passionately curious.\n\nI hope to stay curious and continue to learn and grow in the coming year.\n\nThank you for reading my year in review. I hope that you have enjoyed learning about my experiences and adventures in 2022. I wish you all the best and hope that your future is filled with joy and success. Thank you for your support and here’s to a bright future ahead!"

    "title": "Exploring the Latest Advancements in Transfer Learning: A Summary of ICLR’23 Transfer Learning-Related Papers",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Intro\nThe International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) is one of the top conferences in the field of machine learning, and this year’s conference (ICLR 23) features several papers on the topic of transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique that allows a model trained on one task to be applied to a different but related task, potentially improving performance and reducing the amount of data and computation required. Here are a few papers on transfer learning that are worth keeping an eye on at ICLR 23:\n\n\n\nPapers\n\nLearning Uncertainty for Unknown Domains with Zero-Target-Assumption\n\nTL;DR: New framework that maximizes information uncertainty measured by entropy to select training data in NLP.\n\nThis paper introduces a new framework called Maximum-Entropy Rewarded Reinforcement Learning (MERRL) for selecting training data for more accurate Natural Language Processing (NLP). The authors argue that conventional data selection methods, which select training samples based on test domain knowledge and not on real-life data, frequently fail in unknown domains like patent and Twitter. MERRL addresses this issue by selecting training samples that maximize information uncertainty measured by entropy, including observation entropy like empirical Shannon entropy, Min-entropy, R’enyi entropy, and prediction entropy using mutual information. The authors show that their MERRL framework using regularized A2C and SAC achieves significant improvements in language modeling, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition over various domains, demonstrating strong generalization power on unknown test sets.\nAs an Electronics Engineering background, I expresses genuine affinity to Shannon and his theory, which is the foundation of information theory and a powerful tool for understanding the limits of communication and computation.\n\n\nRepresentational Dissimilarity Metric Spaces for Stochastic Neural Networks\n\nTL;DR: Representational dissimilarity metrics that account for noise geometry in biological and artificial neural responses.\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of quantifying similarity between neural representations, such as hidden layer activation vectors, in deep learning and neuroscience research. Existing methods for comparing deterministic or trial-averaged responses ignore the scale and geometric structure of noise, which are important in neural computation. To address this, the authors propose a new approach that generalizes previously proposed shape metrics to quantify differences in stochastic representations. These new distances can be used for supervised and unsupervised analyses and are practical for large-scale data. The authors show that this approach provides insights that cannot be measured with existing metrics, such as being able to more accurately predict certain network attributes from its position in stochastic shape space.\n\n\nTowards Estimating Transferability using Hard Subsets\n\nTL;DR: Authors propose HASTE, a strategy that ensures better transferability estimation using just a hard subset of target data.\n\nThis paper presents a new strategy called HASTE (HArd Subset TransfErability) for estimating the transferability of a source model to a particular target task, using only a harder subset of target data. HASTE introduces two techniques to identify harder subsets, one class-agnostic and another class-specific. It can be used with any existing transferability metric to improve their reliability. The authors analyze the relation between HASTE and the optimal average log-likelihood and negative conditional entropy, and empirically validate theoretical bounds. The results of experiments across multiple source model architectures, target datasets, and transfer learning tasks show that HASTE-modified metrics are consistently better or on par with the state-of-the-art transferability metrics.\n\n\nThe Role of Pre-training Data in Transfer Learning\n\nTL;DR: We investigate the role of pretraining distribution, data curation, size, and loss and downstream transfer learning\n\nThis paper examines the effect of the pre-training distribution on transfer learning in the context of image classification. The study finds that the pre-training dataset is initially important for low-shot transfer, but the difference between distributions is reduced as more data is available for fine-tuning. Fine-tuning still outperforms training from scratch. The study also investigates the effect of dataset size, observing that larger pre-training datasets lead to better accuracy, but the largest difference in accuracy is seen in the few-shot regime. Additionally, the study looks at the effect of pre-training method, and finds that image-image contrastive pre-training leads to better transfer accuracy compared to language-image contrastive pre-training.\n\n\n\nSome thougts\nIt is unfortunate that the double-blind review process, while well-intentioned, can sometimes result in good research being overlooked. The process, designed to prevent bias in the selection of papers, can also make it difficult for reviewers to properly assess the work of researchers from underrepresented groups or from institutions with less prestige.\nAdditionally, for the researchers whose work was not accepted at this year’s ICLR conference, it can be disheartening and discouraging. But it’s important to remember that the review process is highly competitive and that getting a paper accepted at a top conference like ICLR is a significant accomplishment. And for those whose work was not accepted, it doesn’t mean that their research is not valuable or that they are not good researchers. It is also important to note that there are many other conferences, journals and outlets to present the research and get the recognition it deserves.\nIt’s also important to remember that rejection is a common experience in any field, especially in research. It’s a part of the process of discovery and innovation. It’s important to keep pushing forward, to continue to conduct valuable research, and to keep submitting to conferences and journals. It’s also important to keep an open mind and to look for feedback and constructive criticism. And most importantly, don’t give up.\nIn short, while the double-blind review process has its drawbacks, it’s important to remember that rejection is a part of the process and that good research can come from any institution or researcher. And for those whose work was not accepted, keep pushing forward and don’t give up. Here is some advice from Jonathan Frankle, the author of the infamous “The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis” paper:\n\n\nTime for my usual refrain: Most papers weren't accepted to ICLR, and don't let Twitter fool you into thinking otherwise. Plenty of smart people and great papers didn't get the outcome they wanted, and you're in very good company if that's you right now.\n\n— Jonathan Frankle (@jefrankle) January 22, 2023\n\n\n\n\nConlusion\nOverall, transfer learning is a powerful technique that allows models to be applied to different but related tasks, potentially improving performance and reducing the amount of data and computation required. The papers discussed in this blog post highlight some of the latest research in transfer learning, including methods for transferring knowledge between language and images, between different modalities, and for graph-structured data.\nIt is clear that transfer learning is an active and rapidly growing area of research, and we can expect to see many more exciting developments in the coming years. We look forward to seeing the outcome of these papers and more at ICLR 23.\nIn conclusion, transfer learning has many practical applications and these papers give a glimpse of the future possibilities of transfer learning, it is a promising area of research and have a lot of room for improvement. These papers will give an insight into the latest developments in the field and open up the doors for new research opportunities.\n\nIf you liked this article, you can also find me on Twitter and LinkedIn where I share more content related to machine learning and AI."

The capacity of a network can be controlled by the number of neurons and the number of layers in the network. A network with more neurons and layers can hold more information and therefore has a higher capacity. However, having a higher capacity does not always lead to better performance. Regularization techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, can be used to control the capacity of a network and prevent overfitting, which is when a model is too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As we move into the era of Software 3.0, it’s worth reflecting on the journey that has brought us here. Just as Software 1.0 was about the development of basic computational tools, and Software 2.0 was about the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, Software 3.0 is about the integration of AI with attention mechanisms to create truly intelligent systems.\nIn the early days of AI, we focused on building systems that could mimic human intelligence using techniques like rule-based systems and decision trees. But as data became more abundant and compute power increased, we saw the rise of machine learning and the ability to train large neural networks to perform tasks like image and speech recognition with superhuman accuracy.\nThese systems, while impressive, were still limited in their ability to understand and reason about the world. They were unable to truly understand the meaning of the data they were processing, and were often opaque in their decision-making.\nEnter Software 3.0 and the integration of attention mechanisms. Attention allows AI systems to focus on the most relevant parts of a input, whether it’s an image, a text or a sound. This allows them to make more accurate predictions and decisions, while also giving them the ability to explain their thought process.\nOne example of this is the transformer architecture, which is the backbone of many state-of-the-art natural language processing models. The transformer uses self-attention to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence, allowing it to understand the meaning and context of the text.\nBut attention is not only eating AI, it’s also eating software itself. The ability to focus on relevant information and make better decisions is not limited to AI systems. It can also be applied to other areas of software development, such as user interfaces and recommendation systems.\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI and attention, we can expect to see even more intelligent and explainable systems that are able to understand and reason about the world in ways that were previously impossible. Welcome to the era of Software 3.0."

    "text": "In today’s fast-paced data-driven world, machine learning models play a critical role in many industries, from finance to healthcare to retail. These models are often built using a vast array of features, representing a wide range of data types and sources. But as the number of models and features grows, so too does the complexity of managing these features and ensuring their quality and consistency.\nThis is where the concept of a feature store comes in. A feature store is a centralized repository that stores and manages features used in machine learning models. The goal of a feature store is to simplify the management and organization of features, improve collaboration between teams and models, and enhance the performance of machine learning workflows.\nBut the question remains - do you really need a feature store? The answer, as with many things in life, is not a simple yes or no. The decision of whether or not to use a feature store depends on several factors, including the size and complexity of your organization, the nature of your data and models, and your existing infrastructure and processes.\nIn this article, we’ll explore some of the key benefits and drawbacks of using a feature store and help you determine if it’s the right choice for your organization."

    "section": "Making the Decision",
    "text": "Making the Decision\nSo, do you really need a feature store? The answer depends on your specific needs and circumstances. If you have a large and complex organization with multiple models and teams, and you’re looking to improve collaboration, efficiency, and performance, then a feature store may be a good choice. However, if you have a smaller organization with simple models and workflows, or you’re already using other tools for managing features, then a feature store may not be necessary.\nUltimately, the decision of whether to use a feature store should be based on a careful analysis of the pros and cons and an assessment of your organization’s specific needs and circumstances. Factors to consider include the size and complexity of your organization, the nature of your data and models, and your existing infrastructure and processes.\nBefore making the decision to use a feature store, it is also important to consider alternative options, such as traditional databases, data warehouses, or cloud storage solutions. Each of these options has its own pros and cons and may be better suited for different types of organizations and use cases.\nIn conclusion, a feature store can offer many benefits for organizations looking to improve the management and organization of features, enhance collaboration and performance, and ensure data quality and consistency. However, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons and weigh the costs and benefits before making the decision to use a feature store. With the right approach and careful planning, a feature store can help organizations to unlock the full potential of their data and models and drive more effective and efficient machine learning workflows."
