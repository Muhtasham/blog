    "title": "üñºÔ∏è Exploring the Latest Advancements in Transfer Learning: A Summary of ICLR‚Äô23 Transfer Learning-Related Papers",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Intro\nThe International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) is one of the top conferences in the field of machine learning, and this year‚Äôs conference (ICLR 23) features several papers on the topic of transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique that allows a model trained on one task to be applied to a different but related task, potentially improving performance and reducing the amount of data and computation required. Here are a few papers on transfer learning that are worth keeping an eye on at ICLR 23:\n\n\n\nPapers\n\nLearning Uncertainty for Unknown Domains with Zero-Target-Assumption\n\nTL;DR: New framework that maximizes information uncertainty measured by entropy to select training data in NLP.\n\nThis paper introduces a new framework called Maximum-Entropy Rewarded Reinforcement Learning (MERRL) for selecting training data for more accurate Natural Language Processing (NLP). The authors argue that conventional data selection methods, which select training samples based on test domain knowledge and not on real-life data, frequently fail in unknown domains like patent and Twitter. MERRL addresses this issue by selecting training samples that maximize information uncertainty measured by entropy, including observation entropy like empirical Shannon entropy, Min-entropy, R‚Äôenyi entropy, and prediction entropy using mutual information. The authors show that their MERRL framework using regularized A2C and SAC achieves significant improvements in language modeling, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition over various domains, demonstrating strong generalization power on unknown test sets.\nAs an Electronics Engineering background, I expresses genuine affinity to Shannon and his theory, which is the foundation of information theory and a powerful tool for understanding the limits of communication and computation.\n\n\nRepresentational Dissimilarity Metric Spaces for Stochastic Neural Networks\n\nTL;DR: Representational dissimilarity metrics that account for noise geometry in biological and artificial neural responses.\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of quantifying similarity between neural representations, such as hidden layer activation vectors, in deep learning and neuroscience research. Existing methods for comparing deterministic or trial-averaged responses ignore the scale and geometric structure of noise, which are important in neural computation. To address this, the authors propose a new approach that generalizes previously proposed shape metrics to quantify differences in stochastic representations. These new distances can be used for supervised and unsupervised analyses and are practical for large-scale data. The authors show that this approach provides insights that cannot be measured with existing metrics, such as being able to more accurately predict certain network attributes from its position in stochastic shape space.\n\n\nTowards Estimating Transferability using Hard Subsets\n\nTL;DR: Authors propose HASTE, a strategy that ensures better transferability estimation using just a hard subset of target data.\n\nThis paper presents a new strategy called HASTE (HArd Subset TransfErability) for estimating the transferability of a source model to a particular target task, using only a harder subset of target data. HASTE introduces two techniques to identify harder subsets, one class-agnostic and another class-specific. It can be used with any existing transferability metric to improve their reliability. The authors analyze the relation between HASTE and the optimal average log-likelihood and negative conditional entropy, and empirically validate theoretical bounds. The results of experiments across multiple source model architectures, target datasets, and transfer learning tasks show that HASTE-modified metrics are consistently better or on par with the state-of-the-art transferability metrics.\n\n\nThe Role of Pre-training Data in Transfer Learning\n\nTL;DR:¬†We investigate the role of pretraining distribution, data curation, size, and loss and downstream transfer learning\n\nThis paper examines the effect of the pre-training distribution on transfer learning in the context of image classification. The study finds that the pre-training dataset is initially important for low-shot transfer, but the difference between distributions is reduced as more data is available for fine-tuning. Fine-tuning still outperforms training from scratch. The study also investigates the effect of dataset size, observing that larger pre-training datasets lead to better accuracy, but the largest difference in accuracy is seen in the few-shot regime. Additionally, the study looks at the effect of pre-training method, and finds that image-image contrastive pre-training leads to better transfer accuracy compared to language-image contrastive pre-training.\n\n\n\nSome thougts\nIt is unfortunate that the double-blind review process, while well-intentioned, can sometimes result in good research being overlooked. The process, designed to prevent bias in the selection of papers, can also make it difficult for reviewers to properly assess the work of researchers from underrepresented groups or from institutions with less prestige.\nAdditionally, for the researchers whose work was not accepted at this year‚Äôs ICLR conference, it can be disheartening and discouraging. But it‚Äôs important to remember that the review process is highly competitive and that getting a paper accepted at a top conference like ICLR is a significant accomplishment. And for those whose work was not accepted, it doesn‚Äôt mean that their research is not valuable or that they are not good researchers. It is also important to note that there are many other conferences, journals and outlets to present the research and get the recognition it deserves.\nIt‚Äôs also important to remember that rejection is a common experience in any field, especially in research. It‚Äôs a part of the process of discovery and innovation. It‚Äôs important to keep pushing forward, to continue to conduct valuable research, and to keep submitting to conferences and journals. It‚Äôs also important to keep an open mind and to look for feedback and constructive criticism. And most importantly, don‚Äôt give up.\nIn short, while the double-blind review process has its drawbacks, it‚Äôs important to remember that rejection is a part of the process and that good research can come from any institution or researcher. And for those whose work was not accepted, keep pushing forward and don‚Äôt give up. Here is some advice from Jonathan Frankle, the author of the infamous ‚ÄúThe Lottery Ticket Hypothesis‚Äù paper:\n\n\nTime for my usual refrain: Most papers weren't accepted to ICLR, and don't let Twitter fool you into thinking otherwise. Plenty of smart people and great papers didn't get the outcome they wanted, and you're in very good company if that's you right now.\n\n‚Äî Jonathan Frankle (@jefrankle) January 22, 2023\n\n\n\n\nConlusion\nOverall, transfer learning is a powerful technique that allows models to be applied to different but related tasks, potentially improving performance and reducing the amount of data and computation required. The papers discussed in this blog post highlight some of the latest research in transfer learning, including methods for transferring knowledge between language and images, between different modalities, and for graph-structured data.\nIt is clear that transfer learning is an active and rapidly growing area of research, and we can expect to see many more exciting developments in the coming years. We look forward to seeing the outcome of these papers and more at ICLR 23.\nIn conclusion, transfer learning has many practical applications and these papers give a glimpse of the future possibilities of transfer learning, it is a promising area of research and have a lot of room for improvement. These papers will give an insight into the latest developments in the field and open up the doors for new research opportunities.\n\nIf you liked this article, you can also find me on Twitter and LinkedIn where I share more content related to machine learning and AI."

He made a bold prediction that nobody in their right mind will use autoregressive models 5 years from now. LeCun argued that Auto-Regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) are exponentially diverging diffusion processes, and while the probability of errors can be reduced through training, the problem cannot be entirely eliminated.\nIn other words LLMs are like Micael Scott‚Äôs famous line in The Office:\n\nHis solution is to make LLMs non-autoregressive while preserving their fluency.

    "section": "Addressing the Critical Questions",
    "text": "Addressing the Critical Questions\n\nAs engineers delve into this new world, several questions arise. During the LLM Bootcamp, I explored answers to some of these pressing questions:\n\nAre there any good open-source LLMs?\n\nYes, there are several open-source LLMs available. These models serve as a foundation for researchers and developers to build upon, experiment, and create new AI applications.\nJosh Tobin had great slides on this topic, which will be release soon, but in essence it is more detailed version of the below figure\n\n\n\nComparisons of LLMs from LightningAI\n\n\nSelecting the best model for your use case depends on various factors, including:\n\nOut-of-the-box quality for your task\nInference speed / latency\nCost\nFine-tuneability / extensibility\nData security and license permissibility\nFor most use cases, GPT-4 is an excellent starting point.\n\nProprietary models often offer superior quality and are more suitable for commercial use due to licensing constraints. These models can provide businesses with a competitive edge, as they are specifically designed and optimized for certain tasks and industries. Also, they come with the advantage of reduced infrastructure overhead when compared to serving open-source models.\nIn the past, concerns regarding broad copyright ownership over any output generated by these models have made businesses hesitant to adopt them. However, advancements in technology, such as the Azure OpenAI Service, have begun to address these concerns. OpenAI now empowers users by offering services that enable the use of proprietary models without worrying about copyright issues. This makes it easier for businesses to leverage the benefits of proprietary models while also protecting their intellectual property.\nSome disclaimers on this topic:\n\nSecurity concerns: While the Azure OpenAI Service has made strides in alleviating copyright concerns, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that security concerns still remain. As with any cloud-based service, there is always the potential risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. To mitigate these risks, OpenAI and Azure have implemented rigorous security measures and protocols, such as data encryption and access control. However, businesses should still exercise caution and perform their own due diligence when evaluating the suitability of these services for their needs.\nNo Service Level Agreements (SLAs) yet: There is currently no commitment from OpenAI regarding when SLAs will be provided for these APIs. SLAs typically offer guarantees on service availability, performance, and support response times, which can be crucial for businesses that depend on these services for mission-critical applications. Without SLAs in place, businesses may find it challenging to assess the reliability and stability of these APIs, making it difficult to plan and budget for their integration into commercial projects.\nUpcoming regulations: Additionally, it‚Äôs worth noting that new regulations are on the horizon that could impact the use of proprietary models in certain regions. The European Union is currently working on the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), which aims to create a legal framework for AI systems, including proprietary models. This legislation may introduce new requirements for businesses using AI, such as transparency, accountability, and data protection. As these regulations evolve, businesses should stay informed and adapt their AI strategies accordingly.\n\nOn the other hand, open-source models are a more fitting choice if you require extensive customization and want to ensure data security. They provide greater flexibility in terms of modification and adaptation to meet specific project requirements.\nAdding to the previous discussion on selecting the best LLM for your use case, here are some recommendations for most projects:\n\nStart with GPT-4: This will help you develop a proof of concept to assess the feasibility of your task, similar to prototyping in Python.\nConsider ‚Äúdownsizing‚Äù if cost or latency is a factor: GPT-3.5 and Claude are both good choices with comparable performance. For even faster and cheaper alternatives, explore options provided by any LLM vendor, with Anthropic‚Äôs offering being the most ‚Äúmodern‚Äù choice.\nOpt for Cohere if you need to fine-tune your model: Cohere allows greater flexibility in adjusting the model to better suit your specific needs.\nUse open-source models only when absolutely necessary: Although the open-source landscape is evolving rapidly and will likely become a more viable option in the future, for now, it‚Äôs advisable to use these models only if they are essential for your project.\n\nPersonally I find it quite distressing that LLAMA paper results could not be reproduced.\nBy considering these recommendations, you can make an informed decision about which LLM is most suitable for your project, balancing factors such as cost, performance, customization, and data security.\nWe can expect GPT-3.5 quality to be available in open-source models until the end of 2023. \n\n\nWhat is my moat if I rely on OpenAI APIs?\n\nUtilizing OpenAI APIs provides you with access to state-of-the-art AI technology and regular model updates, which can help you maintain a competitive edge in the market. However, your competitive advantage, or ‚Äúmoat‚Äù comes from your unique implementation of the technology and the value-added services you deliver to your customers.\nFor instance context plays a crucial role in providing LLMs with unique and up-to-date information, but its capacity is limited. To make the most of this limited context, consider augmenting the language model through various methods:\n\nAugment with a larger corpus: Leverage additional data sources to enrich the context and improve the AI‚Äôs understanding of your specific domain or use case.\nAugment with more LLM calls: Make multiple calls to the LLM with different inputs or parameters to generate a diverse range of responses, which can then be combined or refined to produce a more accurate output.\nAugment with external sources: Integrate information from other sources, such as databases, APIs, or domain-specific knowledge bases, to enhance the context and further tailor the AI‚Äôs output to your needs.\n\nBy effectively combining OpenAI APIs with these augmentation strategies, you can create unique, high-value solutions that differentiate your offerings from competitors and strengthen your competitive advantage.\n\n\nIs Prompt Engineering some kind of sick joke?\n\nIn the context of AI and LLMs, a ‚Äúprompt‚Äù refers to the text input given to a language model. ‚ÄúPrompt engineering‚Äù is the skillful process of crafting that input text to achieve desired results from the model.\nLilian Weng has a great blogpost about it here, and she notes that most papers on prompt engineering are tricks that can be explained in a few sentences.\nWhile the term ‚Äúprompt engineering‚Äù may sound whimsical or perplexing, it is a crucial aspect of working with LLMs. By carefully designing prompts, you can harness the power of language models to generate valuable insights, creative ideas, and solutions to complex problems.\nPrompts can be thought of as gateways to the vast knowledge and capabilities of AI language models.\nThey allow you to tap into the potential of these sophisticated systems, but only when you adhere to certain guidelines and best practices.\nDespite the seemingly mysterious nature of prompts, they are an essential tool in the AI practitioner‚Äôs toolkit, and learning how to master prompt engineering will enable you to unlock the full potential of LLMs in various applications.\n\n\nHow can I gather and use feedback from users?\n\nUser feedback is crucial for improving your AI-powered applications. To gather and use feedback effectively, consider implementing feedback loops, in-app surveys, and user testing to gain insights into user preferences and any potential shortcomings of the AI.\nOne approach to incorporating user feedback is to ask an LLM whether the new answer addresses the feedback provided for the old answer. Aim for low-friction, high-signal feedback methods that easily integrate into the user‚Äôs workflow, such as the Accept changes or Thumbs up/down patterns. Longer-form feedback also plays a role in refining AI performance.\nIdentify themes in user feedback that the model does not address, which are often discovered by humans. Adjust the prompt to account for these themes through prompt engineering or by changing the context. The automation of this process is still an open question.\n\n\nShould I be able to code a Transformer from scratch?\n\nWhile it‚Äôs not mandatory, having a deep understanding of the underlying architecture, such as Transformers, can help you better utilize LLMs and troubleshoot issues. However, focusing on practical applications and use cases is often more valuable than delving solely into theoretical aspects.\nFor example, during a fireside chat, Peter Welinder, VP of Product and Partnerships at OpenAI, mentioned that when they first built the API, the inference was slow, but in just three months, they were able to improve the inference speed by 100x. This example illustrates how understanding the underlying architecture, combined with using tools like triton, can help you enhance the performance of your AI applications.\nFor instance, you might need to fine-tune LLMs in certain situations. Here are some recommendations:\n\nUsing GPT-4 might eliminate the need for fine-tuning in most cases.\nReasons to consider fine-tuning:\n\nYou need to deploy smaller models due to resource constraints.\nYou have a large amount of data, and retrieval-based approaches are not performing well.\n\nLow-rank updates or parameter-efficient tuning techniques can make fine-tuning more accessible, allowing you to optimize the LLM for specific use cases without in-depth knowledge of Transformer coding.\n\nAlso this is a there is recent great survey on parameter-efficient tuning.\nUltimately, striking a balance between understanding the underlying principles and focusing on practical applications will empower you to make the most of LLMs in your projects.\n\n\nHow exactly am I supposed to test these damn things?\n\nTesting LLMs can be challenging, but it is essential to ensure the quality of your AI applications. Employ a combination of manual and automated testing, focus on edge cases, and collaborate with domain experts to validate the AI‚Äôs output for accuracy and relevance.\nAs you may already know, LLMs are prone to making mistakes, and improving one aspect of your model may inadvertently compromise another. If people rely on your model, they trust you to maintain performance on their task. Since LLMs are trained on the internet, there is always a risk of drift, and qualitative success can be hard to measure. Additionally, diversity of behaviors means aggregate metrics may not be sufficient.\nTest coverage and distribution shift are closely related concepts. Distribution shift measures how far the test distribution is from a reference distribution and is used to assess data changes. Test coverage measures how well your evaluation set covers your production data and is used to find more helpful evaluation data.\nA key idea in LLM testing is using one LLM to evaluate another. This enables automatic evaluation, which can unlock parallel experimentation. However, you should still conduct some manual checks. Types of feedback to consider include thumbs up/down, written feedback, and corrected answers.\nBy implementing a comprehensive testing strategy that combines automated and manual testing, as well as incorporating feedback mechanisms, you can ensure the quality and performance of your AI applications remain high."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In today‚Äôs fast-paced data-driven world, machine learning models play a critical role in many industries, from finance to healthcare to retail. These models are often built using a vast array of features, representing a wide range of data types and sources. But as the number of models and features grows, so too does the complexity of managing these features and ensuring their quality and consistency.\nThis is where the concept of a feature store comes in. A feature store is a centralized repository that stores and manages features used in machine learning models. The goal of a feature store is to simplify the management and organization of features, improve collaboration between teams and models, and enhance the performance of machine learning workflows.\nBut the question remains - do you really need a feature store? The answer, as with many things in life, is not a simple yes or no. The decision of whether or not to use a feature store depends on several factors, including the size and complexity of your organization, the nature of your data and models, and your existing infrastructure and processes.\nIn this article, we‚Äôll explore some of the key benefits and drawbacks of using a feature store and help you determine if it‚Äôs the right choice for your organization."

If you have a large and complex organization with multiple models and teams, and you‚Äôre looking to improve collaboration, efficiency, and performance, then a feature store may be a good choice. However, if you have a smaller organization with simple models and workflows, or you‚Äôre already using other tools for managing features, then a feature store may not be necessary.\nUltimately, the decision of whether to use a feature store should be based on a careful analysis of the pros and cons and an assessment of your organization‚Äôs specific needs and circumstances. Factors to consider include the size and complexity of your organization, the nature of your data and models, and your existing infrastructure and processes.\nBefore making the decision to use a feature store, it is also important to consider alternative options, such as traditional databases, data warehouses, or cloud storage solutions. Each of these options has its own pros and cons and may be better suited for different types of organizations and use cases.\nIn conclusion, a feature store can offer many benefits for organizations looking to improve the management and organization of features, enhance collaboration and performance, and ensure data quality and consistency. However, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons and weigh the costs and benefits before making the decision to use a feature store. With the right approach and careful planning, a feature store can help organizations to unlock the full potential of their data and models and drive more effective and efficient machine learning workflows."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As we move into the era of Software 3.0, it‚Äôs worth reflecting on the journey that has brought us here. Just as Software 1.0 was about the development of basic computational tools, and Software 2.0 was about the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, Software 3.0 is about the integration of AI with attention mechanisms to create truly intelligent systems.\nIn the early days of AI, we focused on building systems that could mimic human intelligence using techniques like rule-based systems and decision trees. But as data became more abundant and compute power increased, we saw the rise of machine learning and the ability to train large neural networks to perform tasks like image and speech recognition with superhuman accuracy.\nThese systems, while impressive, were still limited in their ability to understand and reason about the world. They were unable to truly understand the meaning of the data they were processing, and were often opaque in their decision-making.\nEnter Software 3.0 and the integration of attention mechanisms. Attention allows AI systems to focus on the most relevant parts of a input, whether it‚Äôs an image, a text or a sound. This allows them to make more accurate predictions and decisions, while also giving them the ability to explain their thought process.\nOne example of this is the transformer architecture, which is the backbone of many state-of-the-art natural language processing models. The transformer uses self-attention to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence, allowing it to understand the meaning and context of the text.\nBut attention is not only eating AI, it‚Äôs also eating software itself. The ability to focus on relevant information and make better decisions is not limited to AI systems. It can also be applied to other areas of software development, such as user interfaces and recommendation systems.\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI and attention, we can expect to see even more intelligent and explainable systems that are able to understand and reason about the world in ways that were previously impossible. Welcome to the era of Software 3.0."

    "section": "",
    "text": "üìù¬†Preface\nAs I look back on the year 2022, I can‚Äôt help but feel a sense of nostalgia and wonder.\n\n\n\nüåä¬†Intro\nIt‚Äôs been a challenging year for many of us, with all the ups and downs that come with life. But despite the difficulties, I remain hopeful that things will get better.\n\n\n‚ú®¬†Some highlights of the year\nOne of the biggest highlights of the year was completing my master‚Äôs thesis. This was a major milestone for me, and one that I dedicated to my late grandfather Boboi Usto, who was an educator and convinced my father to move our family to the city from a distant village to get a better education. I‚Äôm grateful for my grandfather‚Äôs influence and for the opportunity to receive a good education, and I‚Äôm proud of all the hard work I put into my thesis.\nThe experience of completing my thesis was immersive and full of learning, and I‚Äôm now working on making it more generalizable. It‚Äôs an exciting process, and I‚Äôm looking forward to refining my findings and sharing them with a wider audience.\nAs I reflect on the role that my grandfather played in my education and career, I‚Äôm reminded of the importance of appreciating our ancestors and the sacrifices they made to provide opportunities for future generations. It‚Äôs easy to take the things we have for granted, but it‚Äôs important to remember that they are often the result of hard work and dedication on the part of those who came before us.\nIn addition to completing my thesis, I also had the chance to participate in four hackathons this year, and I‚Äôm proud to say that I won in three of them. It was a great experience to work with a team to come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems, and I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to put my skills to the test.\nI also took the opportunity to share my thoughts and experiences through writing. I published two blog posts on Medium, which gave me the chance to reflect on my journey and share my insights with others.\nüî• One of the other major highlights of the year was co-founding MunichNLP community in May and being able to organise 17 events in a short time span. And exchanging thoughts with great researchers from Google Research and Brain team.\nIt‚Äôs been great to be able to bring together individuals who are passionate about machine learning, and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to grow and develop the group in the coming year.\nThe last but by no means least, I found new HOME at MunichRe, on a very interesting and challenging project. I plan to share my learning next year through my writings, so stay tuned.\n\n\nüåÑ¬†Wanderlust within me\nIn addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I also made the most of my time by exploring the beautiful Alps and nature surrounding Bavaria. I also had the chance to travel to new countries, including Italy üáÆüáπ and Switzerland üá®üá≠¬†\nüçù In Italy, I fell in love with the delicious and flavourful cuisine, which was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. From the classic pasta dishes to the mouthwatering pizzas, I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the fresh, high-quality ingredients and simple, yet satisfying flavours.\nüèîÔ∏è In Switzerland, I was mesmerised by the stunning natural beauty of the country, with its soaring peaks and crystal-clear lakes. The mountains were rugged and wild, with trails that led up to breathtaking vistas. And the lakes were so clear and pure that you could see right down to the bottom.\nThese were unforgettable experience and one that I will always treasure.\n\n\nüß©¬†Outro\nAs I look ahead to the next year, I have a few goals in mind. First, I want to make my fitness more consistent. I also hope to give a talk at PyData Berlin conference and attend NeurIPS ‚Äô23 (aka The Deep Learning conference of the year). I believe that setting goals is an important way to stay motivated and to continue to grow and learn, and I‚Äôm looking forward to working towards these goals in the coming year.\nTo conclude, I‚Äôm grateful for all the opportunities I‚Äôve had and for the support of my family, friends, and colleagues. I‚Äôm excited to see what the next year brings, and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to pursue my passions and goals.\nAs Albert Einstein once said,\n\nI have no special talent, I am only passionately curious.\n\nI hope to stay curious and continue to learn and grow in the coming year.\n\nThank you for reading my year in review. I hope that you have enjoyed learning about my experiences and adventures in 2022. I wish you all the best and hope that your future is filled with joy and success. Thank you for your support and here‚Äôs to a bright future ahead!"

    "text": "Unleashing the Power of StarCoder\nWith StarCoder, the possibilities are endless. Let‚Äôs explore some exciting use cases where StarCoder‚Äôs productivity gains truly shine:\n\n1. Efficient Code Generation\nStarCoder simplifies code generation by automating repetitive tasks. With just a few lines of code, you can leverage StarCoder‚Äôs capabilities to generate code snippets tailored to your specific requirements. Whether you need a function definition or a complete code block, StarCoder has got you covered.\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ncheckpoint = \"bigcode/starcoder\"\ndevice = \"cuda\"  # Set to \"cuda\" for GPU usage or \"cpu\" for CPU usage\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True).to(device)\n\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(\"def print_hello_world():\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n\nPro Tip: You can use google collab to avoid memmoru issues\n\n\n\n2. Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion\nStarCoder excels at fill-in-the-middle code completion tasks. By providing context and using special tokens, you can generate code snippets with missing parts accurately filled. This feature is particularly useful when you have an existing codebase and need to complete or modify code segments efficiently.\ninput_text = \"&lt;fim-prefix&gt;def print_hello_world():\\n    &lt;fim-suffix&gt;\\n    print('Hello world!')&lt;fim-middle&gt;\"\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n\n\n3. Enhancing Reasoning and Conversational Tasks\nSurprisingly, StarCoder demonstrates remarkable performance in reasoning and conversational tasks, despite not being explicitly trained on text data. The combination of well-crafted prompts and the model‚Äôs inherent reasoning abilities derived from code pre-training contribute to its success.

The company had to navigate its way through a free graphics card market from Intel and the limitations imposed by Moore‚Äôs Law. Yet, they found a niche small enough that they could dominate with their resources against big players like Intel.\nDuring the discussion, the other startup founders also shared their perspectives when Jensen asked why they chose to compete against well-established alternatives. Their response can be summarized as follows:\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator uses blackshark.ai because it fits their needs much better. They also update the world map more frequently, and with sufficient GPUs, they can do it in real-time.\nMagic is up against the giants of OpenAI and GitHub Copilot, aiming to create the best AGI to empower software engineers. Magic‚Äôs goal is to generate relevant code without the need for fine-tuning or large memory requirements. Nat Friedman, former CEO of GitHub, who was responsible for Copilot during his time, invested in Magic, which speaks volumes. As Jensen noted, startups by definition lack enough engineers, so Magic can help them in that aspect.\nDeepL was also up against Google Translate, but they have significantly improved their translation capabilities."
