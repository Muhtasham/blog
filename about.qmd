Hallo world, I'm Muhtasham Oblokulov. I design, build, and operate machine learning systems. I also (try to) write and speak about ML systems, engineering, and career.

In the past I have been honoured to work under supervision of great educators and researchers such as [Prof.Mujdat Cetin](mujdat.cetin@rochester.edu) from University of Rochester, [Prof.Huseyin Ozkan](huseyin.ozkan@sabanciuniv.edu) from Sabanci University, [Prof. Suayb Arsalan](suayb.arsalan@mit.edu), also great mentors [Dr.Erdem Yoruk](e.yoruk@vispera.co) and [Prof. Dr. Ren√© Brunner](rene.brunner@datamics.com). 

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [MunichRe](https://www.munichre.com/en.html). Previously, I worked at [Alyne](https://mitratech.com/products/alyne/) and [Datamics](https://consulting.datamics.com/).
