Hallo world, I'm Muhtasham Oblokulov. I design, build, and operate machine learning systems. I also (try to) write and speak about ML systems, engineering, and career.

In the past I have been honoured to work under supervision of great educators and researchers such as [Prof.Mujdat Cetin](mujdat.cetin@rochester.edu) from University of Rochester, [Prof.Huseyin Ozkan](huseyin.ozkan@sabanciuniv.edu) from Sabanci University, [Prof. Suayb Arsalan](suayb.arsalan@mit.edu) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also great mentors [Dr.Erdem Yoruk](e.yoruk@vispera.co) and [Prof. Dr. René Brunner](rene.brunner@datamics.com). 

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [MunichRe](https://www.munichre.com/en.html). Previously, I worked at [Alyne](https://mitratech.com/products/alyne/) and [Datamics](https://consulting.datamics.com/).

My current interests are efficient and scalable machine learning systems and fast and scalable AI in production.

To learn more about me, you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhtasham/).

If you want to get in touch, you can send me an email, I'm generally interested in technical problems worth solving. I’m pretty happy with my career. To any recruiters/tech-bros, I'll gladly point it out to you if your manner is inappropriate.

That said; I'm a kind hippy when it comes to interesting problems, so if you just want to briefly discuss a data problem then I'm all ears and known to give free advice.
