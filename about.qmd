Hello and welcome! My name is Muhtasham Oblokulov, and I specialize in the design, development, and operation of machine learning systems. In addition to my hands-on work with ML technologies, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and insights through writing and speaking engagements on topics related to ML systems, engineering, and career development.

As a proud co-founder of [MunichðŸ¥¨NLP](https://munich-nlp.github.io/) and co-organizer of [PyData Munich](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-munchen) and [Munich Langchain Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/munich-langchain-meetup-group/).I'm actively involved in fostering a vibrant community of professionals and enthusiasts who share a common interest in natural language processing and data science

In the past I have been honoured to work under supervision of great educators and researchers such as 

- [Prof.Huseyin Ozkan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseyin-ozkan-78719a129/)
- [Prof.Mujdat Cetin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mujdat-cetin-038a149/)
