Hello and welcome! My name is Muhtasham Oblokulov, and I specialize in the design, development, and operation of machine learning systems. In addition to my hands-on work with ML technologies, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and insights through writing and speaking engagements on topics related to ML systems, engineering, and personal reflections.

As a proud co-founder of [MunichðŸ¥¨NLP](https://munich-nlp.github.io/) and co-organizer of [PyData Munich](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-munchen) and [Munich Langchain Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/munich-langchain-meetup-group/) I'm actively involved in fostering a vibrant community of professionals and enthusiasts who share a common interest in natural language processing and data science

In the past I have been honoured to work under supervision of great educators and researchers such as 

- [Prof.Huseyin Ozkan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseyin-ozkan-78719a129/)
- [Prof.Mujdat Cetin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mujdat-cetin-038a149/)
- [Prof.Suayb Arslan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suayb-s-arslan/)

Also great mentors from industry such as

- [Dr.Erdem Yoruk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erdem-yoruk-785532b6/)
- [Ergin Selim Gonen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esgnn/)
- [Prof.RenÃ© Brunner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renebrunner/)
- [Egor Labintcev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egorlabintcev/)

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Munich Re Group](https://www.munichre.com/en.html). Previously, I worked at [Alyne](https://mitratech.com/products/alyne/) and [Datamics](https://consulting.datamics.com/). To learn more about me, you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhtasham/).

My current areas of interest are AI, infrastructure, open source, and (some) frontier tech. I love tackling challenging technical problems and welcome opportunities for collaboration.

## Fun fact 
I'm passionate about mobile photography. You might have noticed this from the thumbnails of my blog entries.

This thought intrigues me: while visual thumbnails offer an instantaneous snapshot of an image, what serves as the equivalent for language? Our eyes can swiftly scan a set of thumbnails and capture an underlying theme from them. But when it comes to language, what provides that immediate insight? Perhaps such a concept doesn't quite fit in the realm of words.
