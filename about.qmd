Hey there I'm Muhtasham! I hope your world's going well. I'll bet you're cool.

I spent my pre-training days in [Urmetan village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urmetan) and did some supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in Dushanbe, [Tajikistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan). 

During high school, I enjoyed tinkering with computers and participating in various olympiads.

I speak five languages: Tajik, Turkish, Russian, English, and German. I'm also reasonably well-versed in several programming languages.

While it's not easy thing I am trying concentrating intensely on the right problems, and remaining open to fresh perspectives.

Founders: I also participate in angel rounds. Noe warms needed, decision in 15min, your terms.
