### Hallo world

I'm Muhtasham Oblokulov. I design, build, and operate machine learning systems. I also (try to) write and speak about ML systems, engineering, and career.

In the past I have been honoured to work under supervision of great educators and researchers such as 

- [Prof.Mujdat Cetin](mujdat.cetin@rochester.edu) from University of Rochester
- [Prof.Huseyin Ozkan](huseyin.ozkan@sabanciuniv.edu) from Sabanci University 
- [Prof. Suayb Arsalan](suayb.arsalan@mit.edu) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Also great mentors from industry such as

- [Dr.Erdem Yoruk](e.yoruk@vispera.co) 
- [Ergin Selim Gonen](selimgonen@gmail.com)
- [Prof. Dr. Ren√© Brunner](rene.brunner@datamics.com)
- [Egor Labintcev](yegor.labintcev@gmail.com)

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Munich Re Group](https://www.munichre.com/en.html). Previously, I worked at [Alyne](https://mitratech.com/products/alyne/) and [Datamics](https://consulting.datamics.com/).To learn more about me, you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhtasham/).

I am passionate about developing efficient and scalable machine learning systems and applying AI in production environments. I am always eager to explore and solve challenging technical problems. If you would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me via email. Note: I will not tolerate inappropriate behavior from recruiters or tech-bros, but I am happy to provide valuable insights and guidance on data-related issues to anyone who is interested.
