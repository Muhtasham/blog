### Projects 🚀
- 📑 [ECOC based Multi-Class Classification for BCI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9531496) - Developed DNN, under ECOC framework to detect the character out of 40 possibilities that the (disabled) subject wants to communicate via Brain Computer Interface (BCI).

- 📑 [Fault-Tolerant Strassen-Like Matrix Multiplication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9302383) - Designed parity calculations to make matrix multiplication
calculations, using Strassen-Like algorithms on cloud computing environment (with parallel setting) fault-tolerant.

- 📑 [TajBERTo](https://wandb.ai/muhtasham/tajberto/reports/My-learnings-from-training-TajBERTo--VmlldzoyMTEyNDQx) - Developed first ever RoBERTa-like language model based on Tajik language after extensive filtering of the dataset. The model can be used for masked text generation or fine-tune it to a downstream task.
