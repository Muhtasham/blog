After publishing on Medium for a while, I have decided to make the switch to here in order to have a more personalized space to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on this rapidly evolving field.\n\nOn this blog, you can expect to find articles and tutorials on a wide range of machine learning topics, including Machine Learning and Information Theory. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field and sharing that knowledge with others. In addition to written content, I will also be sharing code tutorials and demonstrations to help readers better understand and apply the concepts I discuss.\n\nI hope that this blog will not only serve as a source of information and inspiration for those interested in machine learning, but also as a way for me to connect with like-minded individuals and continue learning from others in the community. Thank you for joining me on this journey and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and growth with all of you. This is my new home on the internet and I am excited to have you all as my virtual neighbors. Let's learn and grow together!"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"Litera","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Hello World and welcome to the new blog!","author":"muhtasham","date":"2022-12-25","categories":["news"],"image":"image.jpg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
