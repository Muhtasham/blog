My name is Muhtasham Oblokulov, and I specialize in the design, development, and operation of machine learning systems. In addition to my hands-on work with ML technologies, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and insights through writing and speaking engagements on topics related to ML systems, engineering, and personal reflections.\n\nAs a proud co-founder of [MunichðŸ¥¨NLP](https://munich-nlp.github.io/) and co-organizer of [PyData Munich](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-munchen) and [Munich Langchain Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/munich-langchain-meetup-group/) I'm actively involved in fostering a vibrant community of professionals and enthusiasts who share a common interest in natural language processing and data science\n\nThroughout my journey, I've had the privilege to work under the supervision of several esteemed educators, researchers, and industry veterans. I am immensely grateful for their guidance and mentorship. Here, I pay homage to these remarkable individuals:\n\n#### Educators and Researchers\n- [**Prof. Huseyin Ozkan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseyin-ozkan-78719a129/)\n- [**Prof. Mujdat Cetin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mujdat-cetin-038a149/)\n- [**Prof. Suayb Arslan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suayb-s-arslan/)\n\n#### Industry Mentors\n- [**Dr. Erdem Yoruk**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erdem-yoruk-785532b6/)\n- [**Ergin Selim Gonen**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esgnn/)\n- [**Prof. RenÃ© Brunner**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renebrunner/)\n- [**Egor Labintcev**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egorlabintcev/)\n\nI'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Munich Re Group](https://www.munichre.com/en.html).

To learn more about me, you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhtasham/).\n\nMy current areas of interest are AI, infrastructure, open source, and (some) frontier tech.

You might have noticed this from the thumbnails of my blog entries.\n\nThis thought intrigues me: while visual thumbnails offer an instantaneous snapshot of an image, what serves as the equivalent for language? Our eyes can swiftly scan a set of thumbnails and capture an underlying theme from them. But when it comes to language, what provides that immediate insight? Perhaps such a concept doesn't quite fit in the realm of words.\n:::\n\n## Explore My Public Talks\nI have had the opportunity to share my insights and knowledge through several public talks over the years.
